    <p>Ever wish you could look up Linux commands or ask questions and receive responses from the terminal? You probably
      need a paid service, an API key with paid usage, or at least an internet connection, right? Not with Llama Terminal
      Completion. Instead, we&#39;ll Run a Large Language Model (think ChatGPT) locally, on your personal machine, and
      generate responses from there.</p>
